# Cloud-Based-Office-Automation
It is a office automation system that deals with cloud protocols to dynamically to store and fetch switch status and sensor's data that allows the user to monitor and control appliances with Raspberry-Pi as an intermediate between circuit and cloud.


Our project is a fairly simple attempt to achieve the goal of office automation. In a broader sense, the whole point of technology is to make our lives simpler by engineering it in ways which suits us. In this project, the main input will be given by us in the form of a speech signal or through the app. In order to process this speech signal which is primarily mechanical i.e. sound, we have developed an application. This application converts the mechanical sound waves into electrically processible signals. It will be converted to a text format which is then sent to the raspberry pi using a Wi-Fi module. The raspberry pi acts as the bridge between the signal processing side and the physical output generation i.e. controlling the working of lights and fans. Then finally a relay module is used to control the outputs from the lights and fans. We are also displaying the temperature and humidity of the room in the app using the DHT sensor.
